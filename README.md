# Ocean Composites
[Composites](https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/en/stable/concepts/samplers.html#composites) are available in several packages in the D-Wave Ocean SDK.
Composites inherit their name from the design pattern they follow, the [Composite Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_pattern).

Using one or more composites, a sampler can be composed with a number of pre- and post-processing layers.

Note: As it stands, composites can only be used to compose [samplers](https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/en/stable/concepts/samplers.html#samplers) for Binary Quadratic Model problems.

## Composites covered in lecture material
The lecture notebook covers several composites, exploring how they can be used and why they are useful!

## Installation

You can run this example without installation in cloud-based IDEs that support 
the [Development Containers specification](https://containers.dev/supporting)
(aka "devcontainers").

For development environments that do not support ``devcontainers``, install 
requirements:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

If you are cloning the repo to your local system, working in a 
[virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) is 
recommended.

## Usage

Your development environment should be configured to 
[access Leapâ€™s Solvers](https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/en/stable/overview/sapi.html).
You can see information about supported IDEs and authorizing access to your 
Leap account [here](https://docs.dwavesys.com/docs/latest/doc_leap_dev_env.html).  

The notebook can be opened by clicking on the 
``Ocean-Composites.ipynb`` file in VS Code-based IDEs. 

To run a locally installed notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
